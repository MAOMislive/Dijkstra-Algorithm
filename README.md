# Dijkstra Algorithm for Single-Source Shortest Path
![forthebadge made-with-java](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-java.svg) \
SSSP stands for Single-Source Shortest Path. This Dijkstra algorithm is used to obtain optimal solution for SSSP problem.

I have used Java prog. language to implement this algorithm.
